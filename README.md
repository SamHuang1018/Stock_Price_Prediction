# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM neural network and Technical Indicators and NLP.


In this project, the goal is to predict the Stock Price of M days into the future looking back at the past N days. With respect to other stock prediction projects, Technical Indicators and the sentiment scores of Finbert are used as regressors, and they can potentially be many. In this way, the use of some regressors combinations proved to be more robust in particular situations of the market (ex: high volatility, strong bullish/bearish trends, etc..) for stock price predictions.


However, keep in mind that to obtain a very precise predicted value in a regression problem like this can be difficult, and in some cases the best approach is to see the output prices series of the model more like a "trend" instead of relying on it as an absolute price value prediction.


Depending on the state of the market, you should also properly choose the number of past days to look at and how far in the future you want to predict. Common sense says that the further you want to predict, the worse the prediction will be and it is valid also in this case.
